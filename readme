BrushConfigUI.cpp - Defines the UI for setting the points for the Bezier Curve to scale the image

correlation.cpp - Contains filter function to run cross correlation on the picture, which will be used to define costs between pixels where the least cost is the highest difference of surrounding pixel colors.

iScissor.cpp - sets up data structures for calculations and uses Dijkstras algorithm to find the least cost path from the starting pixel to the current pixel

ImgView.cpp-  void ImgView::SaveMask(const char *filename) uses the points defined for the bezier curve to save and scale the image
